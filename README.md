## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accesible accordion markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Before I started the challenge, I did some research to find out the best way to markup accordions such that they are accessible. I came across a number of markups that can be used and I decided to go with a `button` wrapped in a heading as question and paragraph wrapped in a `div` as answer. Here's what the code looks like: 

```html
  <div class="question-wrapper">
        <h3><button aria-controls="id-1" aria-expanded="false">How many team members can I invite?</button></h3>
        <div class="answer" aria-controls="id-1" hidden>
          <p>You can invite up to 2 additional users on the Free plan. There is no limit on 
            team members for the Premium plan.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
```

I also learned about the `toggleAttribute` JavaScript method which adds or removes an attribute on a given html element.

### Continued development

I'd want to try out other accessible markup for accordions that I read about in my research to help me determine which one works best, in terms of writing less code and having less problems when styling.
